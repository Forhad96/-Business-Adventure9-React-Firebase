## Introduction

Business Adventure is a corporate tour event organization website developed by me, the sole developer. It's designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for corporate clients.

## Features

### 1. User Profile

- I've implemented user profile functionality, allowing users to create and edit their profiles with the necessary information.

### 2. Development Setup

- To set up the Business Adventure website on your local development environment, follow these steps:
  1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/business-adventure.git`
  2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
  3. Configure the necessary environment variables (if any).
  4. Start the development server: `npm start`

### 3. Private Routes

- Private routes have been added and are restricted to registered users only. Unauthorized users will be prompted to sign in to access these exclusive routes.

### 4. Service Selection

- Users can select from a variety of services offered by Business Adventure.
- I've also implemented the ability for users to add services to their favorites for later consideration.

### 5. Favorites

- Users can add services to their favorites for quick access, aiding them in making informed decisions.

### 6. Error Handling

- I've ensured that the website provides clear error messages for various scenarios, guaranteeing a smooth user experience.
- If any issues arise during registration or other processes, users will receive informative error messages.

### 7. Toasts

- I've added toast messages to confirm significant actions, such as successful registration or other user interactions.

## Error Page

- I've also included an error page to handle unexpected errors gracefully. Users will be redirected to this page if they encounter any unforeseen issues while using the website.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to acknowledge the following packages and libraries that have contributed to the success of this project:
